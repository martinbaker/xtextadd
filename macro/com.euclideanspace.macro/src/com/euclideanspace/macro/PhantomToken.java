/**
 * This is intended to hold a phantom token, that it a token that is read
 * by the parser but is not linked to any text in the editor.
 * 
 * PhantomTokens will typically be inserted into the token stream by a custom
 * TokenSource. TokenSource lives between the lexer and the parser. When the
 * parser calls TokenSource.nextToken() then TokenSource will either call
 * Lexer.nextToken() on or insert a PhantomToken.
 * 
 * A typical use-case for PhantomTokens is Python-like block delineation. Here
 * the TokenSource will read the whitespace and insert PhantomTokens into the
 * token-stream to mark the beginning and end of blocks.
 * 
 * This makes it possible to parse code where it would be difficult or impossible
 * to define a suitable grammar otherwise.
 * 
 * It relies on returning an index range with zero length which feels to
 * me like a hack because it could easily be broken by possible changes
 * in Xtext code.
 * 
 * Technical Background
 * --------------------
 * Here are some technical notes which might help in understanding the code.
 * 
 * The output of the Xtext parser is two separate tree structures:
 * 1) EMF model (semantic model) - used for validation and eventually code generation - I think this
 *    is the equivalent to the AST.
 * 2) Node Model - This is read by the Eclipse JFace text editor component to display and enter the
 *    text. Leaves in this tree are tokens which point to a chunk of text stream which must be
 *    contiguous and non-overlapping with other tokens.
 * 
 * Each token can refer to two separate text values:
 * 1) A start and end index into the text stream. This value will be used for the NodeModel.
 * 2) An explicit text value. This will be used for the EMF model.
 * 
 * So each token can have two values. So if we take the macro example, the index for the macro
 * will point to the macro name and the text value will contain the expansion of the macro.
 * PhantomToken
 * 
 * There is not an explicit mechanism for tokens which need to be used in the parser and will
 * affect the EMF, but do not exist anywhere in the editor, such as the inserted curly brackets
 * in the Python-like example above.
 * 
 * However we can cheat by making the start and stop indexes the same, this means that the token
 * has little effect on the NodeModel. It is still important that the index values are contiguous
 * with the tokens before and after it.
 * 
 * The best way to understand the indexes into the text stream is to think of the indexes as
 * representing the spaces between the characters, not the characters, like this:
 * Index: 	     0 	  	1 	  	2 	  	3 	  	4 	  	5 	  	6 	  	7
 * text stream:   	{ 	  	{ 	  	{ 	  	a 	  	} 	  	} 	  	} 	 
 * 
 * So the first character has index 0:1
 * The second 1:2 and so on.
 * This makes it easier to work out the indexes for composite nodes as well as leaf nodes. So,
 * for example, the composite node holding the outer brackets is 0:7. The inner brackets are 2:5.
